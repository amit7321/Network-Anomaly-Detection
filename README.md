# Network-Anomaly-Detection

In this project we used detect anomaly by using Machine Learning algorithm. We used Decision Tree and KNN to detect anomaly. We used feature selection and Select KBest algorithm to select the features which are most important features to detect the class. We calculated the accuracy around 96% for KNN and 97% for Decision Tree. We used CICIDS 2018 dataset.
