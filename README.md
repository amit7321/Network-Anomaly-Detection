# Network-Anomaly-Detection

In this project we used detect to anomaly by using Machine Learning algorithm. We used Decision Tree and KNN to detect the anomaly. We used feature selection and Select KBest algorithm to select the features which are most important features to detect the classes. We calculated the accuracy around 96% for KNN and 97% for Decision Tree. We used CICIDS 2018 dataset which is a multi-class dataset.
